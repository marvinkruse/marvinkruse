Hey, I'm **Marvin Kruse**, a passionate **software engineer** and **entrepreneur**, mainly involved in decentralized systems, disruptive technology and the open source space. I've always been fascinated with the idea of trustless systems and the opportunities that they offer, so it's just natural that the concept of decentralized systems immediately caught my attention.

As a developer, not a day goes by without me playing around with new tools or concepts. I love to translate ideas into code, where I always strive to push the boundaries and gather new insights in the process. Being an entrepreneur as well, I spend a lot of time finding and implementing new ways to create value and growth, which is not only challenging, but also a lot of fun especially within a great team of motivated people.

As an Ethereum advocate and an active member of the community, I'm either writing smart contracts, implementing novel ideas or learning new fascinating things through discussions with other members and projects.

During my free time and through attending and co-hosting many hackathons in the past, I've been part of a lot of different projects revolving around token mechanics (with ERC20/ERC721, such as rebasing token mechanics), cross-chain dApps, token curated registries, DAOs and voting schemes.
