Hey, I'm **Marvin Kruse**, a passionate **software engineer** and **entrepreneur**, mainly involved in decentralized systems, disruptive technology and open source. I've always been fascinated with the idea of trustless systems and the opportunities that they offer, so it's just natural that the concept of decentralized systems immediately caught my attention.

As a developer, not a day goes by without me playing around with new ideas or concepts. I love to translate ideas into code, where I always strive to test the boundaries and gather new insights in the process. Being an entrepreneur as well, I spend a lot of time finding and implementing new ways to create value and growth, which is not only challenging, but also a lot of fun  especially within a great team of motivated people.

As an Ethereum advocate and an active member of the community, I'm either writing smart contracts, implementing novel ideas or learning new fascinating things through discussions with other members and projects.

During my free time and through attending and co-hosting many hackathons in the past, I've been part of a lot of different projects revolving around token mechanics (with ERC20/ERC721), dApps, token curated registries, DAOs and voting schemes.
